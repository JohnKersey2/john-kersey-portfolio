# John Kersey Portfolio 

## Task
In this challenge, I was to create the bare-blocks of a portfolio page I can alter and build up as I develop programs and learn more as a developer. 

## Grading Criteria
I was to make sure I included:

My name
A recent photo or avatar
"About Me" section
A section showing off my work
Contact section
Navigation section that links to appropriate sections internally
Images for my application
Application images link to deployed applications
First application image has to be larger than other application images
Designed with viewport responsive layout
Deploy the webpage with no errors and provide a quality respository

## Unsolved Issues

No external projects exist, so unable to currently set up project links. As a placeholder, project links will link back to the section or subsection they are in. 


## Future Development Notes

Ensure projects get updated and art changed for real projects
Get more professional headshot
